# Preliminary Designs

I found that in previous projects I was spending a lot of time working out colour swatches, page design/layout and responsiveness on the go and it was taking up more time than necessary.


I took this small project as an opportunity to complete a course in UI design using Figma. This should streamline the design process by pre planning and understanding how the design of the project works, before writing any code.


I completed a set of designs for how this project would look using Figma. The Figma design can be accessed here: https://www.figma.com/file/HnGKNRAbNaHmiLUM3Fhg2Q/TheJuardian?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=VBDWr4HfvBYpeBuW-1


I knew I wanted to make something that looks sleek, clean and super professional. I also want to use this project as an opportunity to send users formatted emails and utilise using pagination. I'll use these Figma designs as a guide to complete the project.
